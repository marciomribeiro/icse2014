  ABSTRACT = {
A software product line (SPL) is an efficient means
to generate a family of program variants for a domain from
a single code base. However, because of the potentially high
number of possible program variants, it is difficult to test all
variants and ensure properties like type-safety for the entire SPL.
While first steps to type-check an entire SPL have been taken,
they are informal and incomplete. In this paper, we extend the
Featherweight Java (FJ) calculus with feature annotations to be
used for SPLs. By extending FJ's type system, we guarantee that
-- given a well-typed SPL -- all possible program variants are welltyped
as well. We show how results from this formalization reflect
and help implementing our own language-independent SPL tool
CIDE.},
